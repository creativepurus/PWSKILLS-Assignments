      "\n",
      "1. Abstract Class : Abstract class can be defined using the ABC base class and the abstractmethod decorator. \n",
      "An abstract class defines a set of abstract methods that must be implemented by any concrete class that inherits from it. \n",
      "Abstract classes provide a high-level interface to the data, hiding the implementation details from the user.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is a technique that allows data to be hidden from the user by encapsulating it within objects. \n",
      "In Python, this can be achieved by defining classes that encapsulate data and provide methods for accessing and manipulating that data. \n",
      "By encapsulating the data within the object, the implementation details are hidden from the user, providing a high-level view of the data. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. Interfaces: An interface is a set of methods that define the behavior of an object without specifying the implementation details. \n",
      "In Python, interfaces can be defined using abstract classes or simply by defining a set of methods that must be implemented by any object that implements the interface. \n",
      "By defining interfaces, we can provide a high-level view of the data, hiding the implementation details from the user.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example of abstraction, Vehicle is an abstract class that defines the start and stop methods as abstract methods. \n",
      "The Car class inherits from the Vehicle class and provides the implementation of the start and stop methods. \n",
      "The Vehicle class provides a high-level view of the data by defining the methods that any vehicle should have, hiding the implementation details.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example of encapsulation, Employee is a class that encapsulates the name and salary data and provides methods to access them. \n",
